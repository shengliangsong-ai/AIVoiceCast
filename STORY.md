# 🌈 Neural Prism: The Stack Story

**Refracting Super-Intelligence into Human Utility.**

## 🪄 Inception
The Neural Prism project began with a simple observation: raw AI models are like high-intensity white light—powerful but blinding. To make them useful for daily life, we needed a "prism" to refract that intelligence into a spectrum of specific, task-oriented tools.

## 🛠️ Built With: The Technical Stack

Neural Prism is built on a **Triple-Layer Sovereign Engine**, designed to balance high-performance AI interaction with absolute user data privacy.

### 1. The Intelligence Layer (Gemini 3)
- **Gemini 3 Pro & Flash**: Handling complex reasoning and high-speed **Neural Simulation**.
- **Gemini Live API**: Multimodal, low-latency voice and vision handshakes.
- **Gemini Image & TTS**: Generative art and emotive speech synthesis.

### 2. The Cloud Infrastructure
- **Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)**: The secure backend for identities and the global ledger.
- **Google APIs (Drive, YouTube, Gmail)**: Powering user-sovereign data persistence and notifications.
- **GitHub API**: Deep version control integration.

### 3. The Edge Data Plane
- **React 19 & TypeScript**: The core application framework.
- **IndexedDB**: Local "Neural Cache" for assets and VFS states.
- **Web Crypto API**: Secure, on-device ECDSA identity management.
- **Monaco & Plotly**: Professional-grade editing and visualization tools.

## 🚀 Key Innovations

### 📂 Heuristic Logic Simulation
We eliminated the need for server-side compilers. In the **Builder Studio**, the AI "imagines" the execution of your code. It's infrastructure-less, secure, and provides Socratic feedback that explains *why* logic works.

### 🧠 Preemptive Neural Rotation
To support long-running activities (like 1-hour mock interviews), we developed a protocol that silently refreshes the AI connection every 5 minutes while maintaining the full conversational context.

## 🌈 The Future: Federated Refraction
We are moving toward a decentralized model where the community defines the "Spectrum." Members will be able to publish their own activity refractions, creating an infinite library of AI-augmented human capabilities.
