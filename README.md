# 🌈 Neural Prism Platform v5.7.0

**Refracting Super-Intelligence into Human Utility.**

Neural Prism is an **Intelligence Hub** designed to bridge the gap between blindingly complex AI models and the spectrum of daily human activities. We leverage **Google Gemini 3** to power 20+ specialized "rainbow tools."

## 🏆 FOR HACKATHON JUDGES: Start Here!

We have created a **Pinned Technical Audit Channel** specifically for your review. It self-evaluates our project against your criteria using the platform's own live audio and knowledge database.

1.  Launch the app.
2.  Select the channel: **🏆 JUDGE: Neural Prism Technical Audit**.
3.  Listen to the AI breakdown of our **40% Technical Execution**, **30% Innovation**, and **20% Potential Impact**.
4.  Open the **Neural Diagnostics Console** (Bug icon) to see the live heartbeat of our Refractive Caching engine.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture: The Refractive Cache

To maximize energy efficiency and minimize API costs, we implement a **Generate-Once-Cache-Forever** model.

1.  **Deterministic UUID Generation**: Every request (a scripture chapter, a technical spec, an app icon) is hashed into a unique **UUID**.
2.  **The Knowledge Ledger (Cloud)**: We check our low-cost Firestore registry first. If the UUID exists, the content is served instantly without hitting the Gemini API.
3.  **Global Handshake**: Refractions are shared. If one member refracts a complex C++ lesson, the entire community benefits from the cached artifact, reducing global token consumption.
4.  **Sovereign Storage**: While metadata is indexed in the Ledger, the "Source of Truth" (Code, PDFs, Audio) resides in the user's **Google Drive**.
