# 🌈 Neural Prism Platform v6.0.0

**Refracting Super-Intelligence into Human Utility.**

Neural Prism is a **Sovereign Intelligence Hub** designed to bridge the gap between complex AI models and the spectrum of daily human activities. We leverage **Google Gemini 3** to power 20+ specialized "rainbow tools."

## 🏆 FOR HACKATHON JUDGES: The Sovereign Lens

We have created a **Pinned Technical Audit Channel** specifically for your review. It self-evaluates our project against your criteria using the platform's own live audio and knowledge database.

1.  Launch the app.
2.  Select the channel: **🏆 JUDGE: Neural Prism Technical Audit**.
3.  Listen to the AI breakdown of our **Technical Execution**, **Innovation**, and **Impact**.
4.  Open the **Neural Diagnostic Console** (Bug icon) to see the live heartbeat of our Refractive Caching engine and the new **Feedback Self-Enhancement Loop**.

## 🏗️ v6.0 Core: The Sovereign Framework

To maximize user privacy and platform stability, we implement a **Sovereign-First** model.

1.  **Triple-Layer Storage**: Sovereignty via **Google Drive**. Metadata is indexed in our Firestore ledger, but the "Source of Truth" (Code, PDFs, Audio, Recordings) resides exclusively in the user's personal cloud.
2.  **Neural Diagnostic Console**: Real-time observability with automated **Trace Bundling**. Users participate in the self-enhancement loop by submitting feedback contextually linked to technical logs.
3.  **High-Fidelity Authoring**: v6.0 introduces **High-DPI Rasterization** for symbol-perfect PDF synthesis, ensuring technical documents preserve all mathematical and linguistic glyphs.
4.  **Recording Scribe**: A new tool in the Archive that allows users to record and sync their neural activities (Screen + Camera) directly to their sovereign vault.
